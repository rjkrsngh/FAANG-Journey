Maximum Product Subarray
Last Updated : 22 Jul, 2025

Given an array arr[] consisting of positive, negative, and zero values, find the maximum product that can be obtained from any contiguous subarray of arr[].

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = [-2, 6, -3, -10, 0, 2]
    Output: 180
    Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is [6, -3, -10] with product = 6 * (-3) * (-10) = 180.

    Input: arr[] = [-1, -3, -10, 0, 6]
    Output: 30
    Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is [-3, -10] with product = (-3) * (-10) = 30.

    Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4]
    Output: 24
    Explanation: For an array with all positive elements, the result is product of all elements.
