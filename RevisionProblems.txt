Important Concepts:
1. Use Kadane's algorithm to find the continuous subarray with max sum
2. Counting sort: Sorts the elems and stores them based on their index.
3. KMP Algorithm for pattern matching


REVISON PROBLEMS:
	ARRAYS
		1. Kadane's algorithm
		2. Max Circular array sum
		3. Find the smallest missing number
		4. Maximum number of 1s(Given an array, find the max ones by flipping k zeros).
		
	STRINGS
		1. Add binary strings
		2. KMP Algorithm(to find all the occurances of a desired string): Practice its application questions <------- VVI
			Add minimum chars in a str to make it a palindrome.
			Check if one string is a rotation of the other.
		3. Generate power set of a string
		4. Generate all permutations of a string
		
	TREES/BST:
		1. Basic operations: Insertion/Deletion/Searching
		2. BFS/DFS
		3. Least common ancestor
		4. Left/right view
		5. Height/Width
		6. Binary tree to BST conversion keeping the original structure intact: 
			take the inorder traversal of binary tree in inorderList
			sort the inorderList
			traverse on the binary tree using inorder and update the values from inorderList.
		7. Add all greater values to every node in a BST(------->VVI<-------).
		
	GRAPH
		1. BFS/DFS
		2. Connected/Strongly Connected components (number of islands)
		3. Shortest path finding (dijkstra's algorithm)
		4. Cycle Detection in directed/undirected graph.
